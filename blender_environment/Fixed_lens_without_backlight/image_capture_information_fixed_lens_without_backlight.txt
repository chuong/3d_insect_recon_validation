Lens setup: Fixed lens
Lighting condition: Without backlight
Magnification, M = 0.50711
Focal length of the lens, f = 65 mm (average_lens_focal_length)
Aperture = f/2.8 

scaling=0.004
Camera distance = 0.2m (average_focus_distance)
Backward translation = -0.019m
Forward translation = 0.021m

Camera number: 13 (No. of tilt position)
Camera offset angle (tilt angle) = 15 degree
Stacking no. (No. of images in the stack) = 61
Rotation step angle = 15 degree
No. of Rotation step = 24

max_focus_distance = average_focus_distance + forward_translation 
min_focus_distance = average_focus_distance + backward_translation
